Feel free to request features on the Github issue tracker.
Our roadmap currently looks like this:

* Python 3 support (pending CQLEngine)
* Documentation improvements
* CQLEngine & Python driver upgrade
* Database backend so you can get started easily

Future

* Relevancy based feeds
* Include an API similar to getstream.io so Ruby, PHP and Node folks can also use Stream Framework.
